# Competitive Virtual Cycling over 5G

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for our final year project focused on Competitive Virtual Cycling over a 5G network. The primary objective is to create an immersive cycling experience using a 360-degree video virtual simulator with resistive feedback while ensuring minimum communication latency through the utilization of UDP and 5G technologies.
<!--
## Objectives

1. Develop a 360-degree video virtual cycling simulator with resistive feedback.
2. Achieve minimum communication latency using UDP and 5G technologies.
3. Extend the simulator to support a 2-person competitive environment with avatars representing each player in the other's view.

## Uniqueness

The project's uniqueness lies in its:
- Immersive experience within a real-world environment.
- Competitive mode allowing for head-to-head cycling challenges.
- Low latency to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.
- User-friendly interface for intuitive interaction.
